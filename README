                             PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
                             ===================

The Frontier distributed database caching system distributes data from
data sources to many client systems around the world. The name comes
from "N Tier" where N is any number and tiers are layers of locations
of distribution. The central data source is located at Tier 0, and the
Frontier system distributes data to to all the Tier 1, Tier 2, and
Tier 3 sites.  Within each site the Frontier system also distributes
the data to all the worker nodes (typically hundreds or thousands)
that need to read the data. The protocol is http-based and uses a
RESTful architecture which is excellent for caching and scales well.
The Frontier system uses the standard web caching tool squid to cache
the http objects at every site. Frontier uses a plugin architecture
that allows great flexibility in the data transferred.  Back ends are
currently available for SQL-based databases, http web servers, and
files.  The main advantage of using Frontier with a web server, as
opposed to directly using the web server with a squid proxy, is that
years of experience have resulted in Frontier supplying many features
that are important for robust and flexible operation on computing
grids.
