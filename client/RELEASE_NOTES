v2_4_5_cms 06/16/2006 (dwd)
 - prevent the attempted build of the internal expat from deleting
   $(EXPAT_DIR) if it is passed on the make command line, and from
   installing the internal expat into the external $(EXPAT_DIR).
 - add showing the server version in the debug log

v2_4_4_cms 06/07/2006 (dwd)
 - added optional zipping of the retrieved payload.  The C++ API is
   Request::setRetrieveZipLevel(level) where 0 is off, 1 is fastest,
   5 is normal, and 9 is best compression.  Default is 5.  Requires
   corresponding update in frontier servelet, version 3.1 or greater.
 - eliminated another header file compile problem in FrontierException.hpp
   just like the one recently fixed in frontier-cpp.h, and eliminated
   a compile error seen when the inline LogicError constructor from
   the same file is used
 - eliminated some compiler warnings in frontier-cpp.h

v2_4_3_cms 06/01/2006 (dwd)
 - fixed a compile problem seen on amd64 in frontier-cpp.h
 - added frontier_initdebug C function that accepts a debug log file name
   and log level, and a frontier::init overloaded function that accepts
   the same two parameters

v2_4_2_cms 12/25/2005 (sv)
 - support for configuring client with multiple servers/proxies
 - initial work on exceptions for the C++ api

v2_4_1_cms 10/25/2005 (sv)
 - distribution changes: if external $EXPAT_DIR is provided, the expat
   files will not be included in the frontier library; however, client
   application will have to link against external libraries in $EXPAT_DIR/lib

v2_4_0_cms 10/12/2005 (sv)
 - cms pool clients seem to be working 
 - fn-any, fn-req are not working against service on edge due to interface 
   change relative to v2_3_1 release

v2_1_2 01/20/2005
 - bugs in NULL strings fixed
 - diagnostic message from server now included into error message
 - fn-any now shows strings in single quotes. Quotes and backslashes inside
   strings are C-style escaped.
 - for NULL strings fn-any pronts NULL (without quotes).
