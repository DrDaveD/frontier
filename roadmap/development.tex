\chapter{Development Approach}

\begin{fixme}
Here we discuss the incremental approach we are using to develop this
product. The basic idea is that we make small steps forward in
technology and complexity and test and evaluate them to make sure we
are moving in the right direction. The steps turn into a series of
experiments.
\end{fixme}

\section{Experiment Monitoring---Capture and Reporting}

The data recorded from a test or experiment must be captured and
tagged in a global place so that everyone can analyze it.

\begin{fixme}
More is needed here.
\end{fixme}

\section{Experimental Environment}

\begin{fixme}
What machines or configuration is needed to run the tests and
experiments we need to run?
\end{fixme}

\section{Experiment Sequence}

\begin{fixme}
Here we discuss a potential series of tests or experiment that will
address the questions of whether or not the system will perform as
expected.
\end{fixme}

\section{Possible Configurations}

\begin{fixme}
What are some of the ways we to configure products like squid? We want
to determine the set of configurations that we will promote and
support.
