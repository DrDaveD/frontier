3.4 2006/10/26 (dwd)
    - Added support for oracle BLOB (Binary Large OBject) types
    - Added two optional parameters to WEB-INF/classes/config.properties:
	CacheExpireSeconds - number of seconds after queries in which
	  the caching of the query should expire.  Default is 7 days of
	  seconds, 604800.
	CacheExpireHourOfDay - the hour of the day at which all
	  query caching should expire, if less than CacheExpireSeconds.
	  For example, if it is set to "23", all items will expire at
	  11:00 p.m. in the local time of the server.  Default is
	  to use CacheExpireSeconds instead.

3.3 2006/09/05 (dwd)
    - Fixed bug where the keepalive message task wasn't shut down if
      the database connection failed
    - Added a refinement to Luis Ramos' patch of 3.1: don't add the
      parenthesized precision after the NUMBER data type if the
      precision is zero

3.2 2006/07/26 (dwd)
    - Added sending a keepalive message to the client every 5 seconds
      while waiting to acquire a database connection, to avoid client
      timeouts under heavy load
    - Added sending the servlet version to the catalina log and the
      client
    - Reduced non-useful debugging output to the catalina log and
      improved some others

3.1 2006/06/07 (dwd)
    - Added feature to zip the retrieved payload using gzip levels 0-9
      where level 0 is no zipping, level 1 is fastest but least
      compressed, and level 9 is slowest but most compressed
    - Added precision in parentheses to the NUMBER data type.  Requested
      by Luis Ramos of CERN and patch supplied by him
    - Cleaned up some exception message typos

3.0 and earlier releases did not have release notes
