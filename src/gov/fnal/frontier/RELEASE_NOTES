    - When a blob is null, send a null indication rather than empty.
      This is the more correct way to handle null blobs than what was
      put in in release 3.5.

3.8 2007/05/24 (dwd)
    - Back out change from 3.7 because that ends up eliminating the
      Content-Length header from even small responses, causing squid
      to drop the connection after every query instead of keeping
      persistent connections.  Instead, we will rely on squid 2.6's
      "collapsed_forwarding" feature to maximize sharing.  Also fix an
      inadvertent too-early sending of the response header that was
      put in in version 3.5.  Add a log message about the response
      being precommitted whenever the header is committed early,
      resulting in the removal of Content-Length.  This now happens
      only when responses take up more than the default 8K buffer in
      the ServletOutputStream.

3.7 2007/05/01 (dwd)
    - Send response headers as soon as possible to maximize the
      sharing that squid does.

3.6 2007/04/05 (dwd)
    - Get the transaction id (with a -ka suffix) into log messages
      from the keepalive thread

3.5 2007/03/22 (dwd)
    - Cleaned up log messages so those that occur regularly all will
      show timestamp and thread id
    - Greatly improved performance for blobs, for small rows, and for
      zipping
    - Replaced Base64 encode/decode implementation with much simpler/
      cleaner version
    - Eliminate null pointer exception on null blobs
    - Renamed CacheExpireSeconds and CacheExpireHourOfDay to 
      LongCacheExpireSeconds and LongExpireHourOfDay.  Added two new
      parameters ShortCacheExpireSeconds and ShortCacheExpireHourOfDay
      which are the same except apply to all queries that have
      "&ttl=short" (ttl stands for time-to-live).  The default on
      ShortCacheExpireSeconds is 0.
    - Catch all Throwables, not just Exceptions, so that Errors are
      also included and debugged
    - When an Exception or Error occurs pass the function, source file
      number, and line number to the application in addition to the
      name of the throwable
    - The "stop" log message now includes the entire transaction, so
      the number of active threads and the elapsed time are more
      meaningful

3.4 2006/10/26 (dwd)
    - Added support for oracle BLOB (Binary Large OBject) types
    - Added two optional parameters to WEB-INF/classes/config.properties:
	CacheExpireSeconds - number of seconds after queries in which
	  the caching of the query should expire.  Default is 7 days of
	  seconds, 604800.
	CacheExpireHourOfDay - the hour of the day at which all
	  query caching should expire, if less than CacheExpireSeconds.
	  For example, if it is set to "23", all items will expire at
	  11:00 p.m. in the local time of the server.  Default is
	  to use CacheExpireSeconds instead.

3.3 2006/09/05 (dwd)
    - Fixed bug where the keepalive message task wasn't shut down if
      the database connection failed
    - Added a refinement to Luis Ramos' patch of 3.1: don't add the
      parenthesized precision after the NUMBER data type if the
      precision is zero

3.2 2006/07/26 (dwd)
    - Added sending a keepalive message to the client every 5 seconds
      while waiting to acquire a database connection, to avoid client
      timeouts under heavy load
    - Added sending the servlet version to the catalina log and the
      client
    - Reduced non-useful debugging output to the catalina log and
      improved some others

3.1 2006/06/07 (dwd)
    - Added feature to zip the retrieved payload using gzip levels 0-9
      where level 0 is no zipping, level 1 is fastest but least
      compressed, and level 9 is slowest but most compressed
    - Added precision in parentheses to the NUMBER data type.  Requested
      by Luis Ramos of CERN and patch supplied by him
    - Cleaned up some exception message typos

3.0 and earlier releases did not have release notes
